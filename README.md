# R---Neural-Networks
Neural Network Analysis on 
This project involves using R to examine a dataset containing heart disease information. My analysis involves creating neural network models to predict a patient's vital status at the time of their last follow-up session (whether they are alive or dead). I will create three models and tune their parameters to produce the most accurate model possible.

The full report can be found in the file "Neural Network.pdf". This report shows a complete breakdown of my analysis, including problem identification, motivation, data exploration, data preparation, data partition, predictive modeling, model results, model tuning, and proposed solutions. Tables, visualizations, and a copy of my code are included in the appendices.

The dataset "whas1.csv" was provided by my course instructor at the University of Maryland University College. The original data source and variable description were from Hosmer, Lemeshow, and May (1998).

The R script is included in the file "neural network script.R". The requirements are described in the file "requirements.txt". Instructions on how to use the program are included as comments in the R file. After opening the file, please read the instructions carefully before executing the code to ensure that the program functions correctly.
